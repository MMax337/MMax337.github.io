# COBOL ![](https://www.tiobe.com/wp-content/themes/tiobe/tiobe-index/images/COBOL.png)
### What is COBOL?:
- COBOL (/ ˈ k oʊ b ɒ l,-b ɔː l /; an acronym for "common business-oriented language") is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed for business use. It is an imperative, procedural, and, since 2002, object-oriented language. COBOL is primarily used in business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments.

### What is COBOL used for?:
- Many COBOL developers are nearing retirement age, and younger coders are less likely to learn it. This means that when problems arise, many companies no longer have a COBOL expert on hand. But it's still used extensively: more than 95% of ATM swipes and 43% of banking systems are written in COBOL.

### AI Joke:
- Why do COBOL programmers always carry a pencil?  Because they want to keep their code "write"!
