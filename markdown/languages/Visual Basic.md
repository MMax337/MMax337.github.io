### What is Visual Basic?:
- Visual Basic was designed to be a complete programming language that contained ordinary features, such as string processing and computation. The visual environment is characterized by a drag-and-drop feature which allows programmers to build a user interface that is easy to use, even for developers with minimum experience.

### What is Visual Basic used for?:
- Visual Basic is written in Visual Studio and can be used to create executable files that can run independently. On the other hand, VBA only works within a Microsoft Office host application: Word, Outlook, Excel, Access, or PowerPoint.

### AI Joke:
- Why did the Visual Basic programmer get kicked out of school?  Because they kept trying to "Dim" everyone!
