### What is Assembly language?:
- What is Assembly Language? Assembly language is a low-level language that helps to communicate directly with computer hardware. It uses mnemonics to represent the operations that a processor has to do. Which is an intermediate language between high-level languages like C++ and the binary language.

### What is Assembly language used for?:
- Assembly language uses a mnemonic to represent, e.g., each low-level machine instruction or opcode, each directive, typically also each architectural register, flag, etc.Some of the mnemonics may be built-in and some user-defined. Many operations require one or more operands in order to form a complete instruction.

### AI Joke:
- Why do Assembly language programmers prefer to work alone?  Because they can't stand all the high-level drama!
