### What is Scratch?:
- Scratch is a free programming language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations.

### What is Scratch used for?:
- Scratch is used as the introductory language because the creation of interesting programs is relatively easy, and skills learned can be applied to other programming languages such as Python and Java. Scratch is not exclusively for creating games. With the provided visuals, programmers can create animations, text, stories, music, art, and more.

### AI Joke:
- Why did the Scratch programmer break up with their partner?  Because they kept getting stuck in loops!
