# Delphi/Object Pascal ![](https://www.tiobe.com/wp-content/themes/tiobe/tiobe-index/images/Delphi_Object_Pascal.png)
### What is Delphi/Object Pascal?:
- Devised by Niklaus Wirth in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Pascal is a programming language.

### What is Delphi/Object Pascal used for?:
- Borland used the name Object Pascal for the programming language in the first versions of Delphi, but later renamed it to the Delphi programming language. However, compilers that claim to be compatible with Object Pascal are often trying to be compatible with Delphi source code.

### AI Joke:
- Why did the Delphi programmer break up with their partner?  Because they couldn't handle the "object" in the relationship!
